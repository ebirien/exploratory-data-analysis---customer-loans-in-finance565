# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance
## Project Description
This project was undertaken for a large financial institution, where loans managiment forms a critical component of business operations.

Exploratory data analysis was conducted on the loan portfolio data, with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of the risk and return associated with the business' loans.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate a working advanced knowledge of Exploratory data analysis with Pandas and Python programming language. Several python classes were created to extract data from the cloud, convert columns to the correct format, get information from the DataFrame, perform EDA transformation on the data, and remove/impute missing data.

The project involved the following tasks:
1. Setting up the development environment
  - Github
  - Visual studio code

2. Extraction of the loans data from the cloud
  - Created a python class for data extraction
  - Extracted the data from RDS database hosted in AWS cloud
  - Familiarised myself with the data in preparation for EDA

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Converted columns to the correct format
  - Created a python class to get information from the DataFrame
  - Remove/impute missing values in the data
  - Performed transformations on skewed columns
  - Removed outliers from the data
  - Dropped overly correlated columns

4. Analysis and Visualisation
  - Determined the current state of the loans
  - Calculated loss
  - Calculated projected loss
  - Computed possible loss
  - Identified indicators of loss
